These are the supporting materials for Hartmann, Roberts, Valdes and Grollemund (submitted).

It covers the data collection, munging and ancestral state reconstruction.

The main processed data file is `data/processed/GTree_phylo4g_withClimateSimData.RDat`.


The folder `processing/` shows each step of the processing, with files starting `P1_*`, `P2_*`, `P_3*` etc. This continues to the ancestral state reconstructions in the folder `analysis/AncestralStateReconstruction/` P4 to P7.

Some raw data files are not included in the public repository.
